  The Entrepreneurs Act (Law 27349) approved in March 2017, represents ArgentinaÂ´s strong commitment to support entrepreneurs and create an environment where Argentine ideas, talent, and creativity can flourish. This Act established a new and agile type of business entity, the Venture Capital Institutions Registry, and became the first regulation for Crowdfunding platforms in a Latin American country.
  <br/><br/>
  The Entrepreneurs Act establishes a new type of business entity, the "Simplified Joint-Stock Companies" (SAS by its Spanish acronym). Under this legal framework, it takes 24 hours to create a new company online, open a bank account, and register it before the Tax Collector Office.
  <br/><br/>
  The Entrepreneurs Act also creates the Venture Capital Institutions Registry that allows investors, managers, and organizations to benefit from tax deductions from investments. This incentive will contribute to federalize Venture Capital investments in Argentina by giving more benefits to less developed Argentinian regions.
  <br/><br/>
  Capital investment contributions made by venture capital investors may be deducted from income tax, under certain conditions and in the amounts set forth in relevant regulations, which shall exceed neither seventy-five percent (75%) of such contributions nor ten percent (10%) of the net taxable income for the fiscal year or its proportional amount based on the number of months in operation.
  <br/><br/>
  Additionally, it establishes a Fiduciary Fund for Venture Capital Development (FONDCE by its Spanish acronym). This Fund offers different financing programs for entrepreneurs and startups, such as Seed Fund Program, Accelerator Fund Program, and Expansion Fund Program.
