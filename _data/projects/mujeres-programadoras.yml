  Launched within the framework of “Aprender Conectados”, a plan for  digital literacy by the Ministry of Education, “Mujeres Programadoras” is a program that aims at strengthening the participation of women in leading roles related to programming and digital culture.
  <br/><br/>
  Along to every stage of compulsory education, the program fosters the use of digital skills, such as programming and robotics,  to address the gender gap existing in this area from multiple dimensions.  Besides raising awareness, it carries out activities encouraging women to perform tasks regarded as difficult and traditionally dominated by men.
