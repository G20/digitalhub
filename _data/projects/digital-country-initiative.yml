Concretely, this program provides IAS (Infrastructure as a service)/ PAS (Platform as a service) and SAS (Software as a service) at no cost for the first 2 years, as well as connectivity and Free Wi-Fi. Since its design in 2016, it has been rolled out to 900 municipalities, out of a total of 2171. Current solutions package includes Customer Relationship management system, web page, and collaboration tools, among others. This program is also complemented with “Digital Point”, an initiative that provides computer labs and oriented-to-the-digitally-excluded training programs in municipalities throughout the country.
